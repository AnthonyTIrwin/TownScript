# TownScript Community Token Project
The purpose of this project is to provide a semi-centralized giftcard platform where individuals trade a stablecoin like Dai for a localized currency(script),
which can be spent at businesses and resturants (merchants) in a certain geographical area.

## Goal of contract
Anyone can purchase the local token, they can trade it among other users, but the stablecoin used to pay for it remains locked in a contract and can only be redeemed by a set
of approved merchant account addresses. Ideally like a gift card, this will commit a certain amount of capital in the form of Dai to a certain region and foster econmic 
activity. 

## Future of Project
Currently the contract is set up for an adminisrator account to manually add addresses to the Merchant cash-out redemption account, but in the future with a robust 
token-based personal ID system, it should be possible to allow merchants to add themselves to the contract.
